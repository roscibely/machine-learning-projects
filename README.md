# Machine learning projects 
Some machine learning projects implemented during my BSc in Computer (2016).


## [k-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/roscibely/machine-learning-projects/tree/master/k-nearest-neighbors)

Implementation of k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for wine üç∑ classification.

   1. The data were obtained through the [website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data)
   2. [More specifications](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)

## [Genetic Algorithm (GA)](https://github.com/roscibely/machine-learning-projects/tree/master/genetic-algorithm)

Smallest-circle problem with GA: The problem is that a certain number of discs are put in order to cover all points. It is analogous to the real problem of location of the telecommunications antennas in the geographical space.
